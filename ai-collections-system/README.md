# AI Collections System - N8N Workflow Implementation

An advanced AI-powered collections system that achieves 95% automation through intelligent workflow orchestration, personalized messaging, and autonomous settlement negotiations.

## 🎯 Overview

This system implements a complete AI-driven collections workflow based on the comprehensive strategy outlined in `ai-collections-strategy.md`. The system handles 500-1000 daily communications with minimal human intervention, achieving industry-leading response rates through hyper-personalization and intelligent automation.

### Key Features
- **95% Automation Rate** - Handles most customer interactions without human intervention
- **AI-Powered Personalization** - Two specialized AI agents for outreach and response handling
- **Autonomous Negotiations** - Settlement authority within pre-defined limits
- **Natural Conversation Flow** - Human-like timing and contextual responses
- **Comprehensive Monitoring** - Real-time Slack alerts and daily reports
- **A/B Testing Built-in** - Three message variants with performance tracking

## 📊 Expected Outcomes

- **25%+ Response Rate** (vs. industry average 5-10%)
- **60% Settlement Acceptance Rate**
- **72-Hour Average Collection Time**
- **300%+ ROI Within 90 Days**
- **40% Increase in Total Collections**

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- N8N instance (v1.0+)
- MySQL database with loan history
- Redis server
- OpenAI API key (GPT-4 access)
- GoHighLevel account
- Slack workspace

### Installation Steps

1. **Import workflows into N8N:**
   - Open N8N interface
   - Go to Workflows > Import
   - Import each JSON file from this folder

2. **Configure credentials:**
   Follow the detailed instructions in `workflow-configuration-guide.md`

3. **Set up webhooks in GoHighLevel:**
   - Cold Outreach: `https://your-n8n.com/webhook/collections/cold-outreach`
   - Response Handler: `https://your-n8n.com/webhook/collections/response`

4. **Create Slack channels:**
   - #collections-activity
   - #collections-payments
   - #collections-settlements
   - #collections-escalations
   - #collections-reports

5. **Activate workflows:**
   Enable each workflow in N8N interface

## 🤖 AI Agents

### Agent #1: Cold Outreach Strategist
Creates personalized initial contact messages based on:
- Complete loan history
- Payment patterns
- Personality profiling
- Settlement authority

**Outputs:** Three message variants for A/B testing
- Variant A: History-based messaging
- Variant B: Emotional/relationship focus
- Variant C: Settlement offer lead

### Agent #2: Response Handler
Autonomously handles all customer responses with:
- Intent detection (payment, negotiation, hardship, dispute, hostile)
- Settlement negotiation within authority
- Payment plan creation
- Escalation when needed

## 💾 Data Flow

### Cold Outreach Flow
1. GHL webhook triggers on new collection account
2. MySQL query retrieves complete loan history
3. Settlement authority calculated
4. Customer profile cached in Redis (7-day TTL)
5. AI Agent #1 generates 3 message variants
6. 30-second natural delay
7. Message sent via GoHighLevel
8. Conversation state initialized in Redis
9. Activity logged to Slack

### Response Handler Flow
1. GHL webhook triggers on customer response
2. Redis lookup for instant profile access (no MySQL query)
3. AI Agent #2 analyzes and responds
4. Intent-based routing (Switch node)
5. Human escalation check (If node)
6. 90-second natural delay
7. Response sent via GoHighLevel
8. Conversation history updated in Redis
9. Appropriate Slack channel notified

## 📈 Settlement Authority Matrix

| Days Past Due | Max Discount | Payment Plan | Immediate Bonus |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|
| 0-30 days | 15% | Not offered | Extra 5% |
| 31-60 days | 25% | 3 months | Extra 5% |
| 61-90 days | 35% | 6 months | Extra 5% |
| 90+ days | 40% | 6 months | Extra 5% |
