# AI Collections Strategy
## Complete Implementation Guide

---

## Executive Summary

We're building a **95% autonomous AI collections system** that handles 500-1000 daily communications with personalized, intelligent messaging that adapts based on customer history and real-time responses. The system uses two specialized AI agents, leverages complete loan history for hyper-personalization, and operates within pre-defined settlement authority to negotiate and close deals without human intervention.

**Key Outcomes:**
- 25%+ response rate (vs. industry average of 5-10%)
- 95% automation rate (only 5% need human intervention)
- 60% settlement acceptance rate
- 72-hour average collection time
- 300%+ ROI within 90 days

---

## Problem Statement

### Current Pain Points
1. **Generic messaging** - Copy-paste templates getting ignored
2. **Low response rates** - Current messages too impersonal
3. **Manual bottleneck** - Agents spending time on repetitive tasks
4. **No personalization** - Rich customer data sitting unused
5. **Inconsistent follow-up** - Missed opportunities from poor timing
6. **Human dependency** - Every negotiation requires manual intervention

### The Vision
Create an AI system that communicates like your best collections agent - empathetic, persistent, strategic, and able to close deals autonomously while maintaining compliance and customer relationships.

## System Architecture

### Core Technology Stack

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| **Orchestration** | N8N | Workflow engine managing all processes |
| **Database** | MySQL | Source of truth for loan history |
| **Cache** | Redis | Fast data access (7-day TTL) |
| **Communication** | GoHighLevel (GHL) | SMS/Email delivery |
| **Intelligence** | OpenAI GPT-4 | Two specialized AI agents |
| **Monitoring** | Slack | Audit trail and escalations |

### Data Flow Architecture

#### Cold Outreach Flow
```
1. GHL Webhook Trigger (new account in collections)
2. MySQL Query (complete loan history)
3. Redis Cache (store profile & init conversation)
4. AI Agent #1 (generate personalized messages)
5. Natural Delay (30 seconds)
6. Send via GHL API
7. Update Redis & Log to Slack
```

#### Response Handling Flow
```
1. GHL Webhook (customer response received)
2. Redis Lookup (instant - no MySQL query)
3. AI Agent #2 (analyze & respond)
4. Natural Delay (90 seconds)
5. Decision Point (human needed?)
6. Send Response via GHL
7. Update Redis & Log to Slack
```

## The Two-Agent AI System

### Agent 1: Cold Outreach Strategist

**Purpose:** Create first-contact messages that generate responses

**Input Data:**
- Complete loan history from MySQL
- Total loans taken and repaid
- Average days to payment
- Preferred payment dates
- Current balance and days overdue
- Behavioral personality profile

**Output:** Three message variants for A/B testing

#### Message Variant Examples

**Variant A - History-Based**
> "Hi John, you've paid 5 loans perfectly, always on the 15th. Tomorrow's the 15th - perfect time to handle this $400 balance. Quick link: [URL]"

**Variant B - Emotional/Relationship**
> "John, we've been through 5 loans together. This isn't like you to be 45 days late. Everything okay? Let's work this out: [URL]"

**Variant C - Settlement Offer**
> "John, quick offer: Clear your $400 balance for just $275 today only. That's 31% off. Accept here: [URL]"

### Agent 2: Response Handler

**Purpose:** Autonomously handle ALL inbound messages

**Capabilities Matrix:**

| Intent Detected | AI Response | Action Taken |
|----------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Payment Commitment** | "Perfect! Here's your link..." | Send payment link |
| **Negotiation** | "I can do $X if paid today..." | Approve within authority |
| **Hardship** | "Let's work out a plan..." | Offer payment plan |
| **Dispute** | "I show loan from [date]..." | Provide evidence |
| **Hostile/Legal** | "Please contact legal@..." | Escalate to human |
| **Confusion** | "This is about your loan..." | Clarify and educate |

#### Response Examples

**Customer:** "I can only pay 200"
> **AI:** "I understand money's tight. My minimum is $260, but if you can do $275 today, I'll mark this paid in full. Deal? [LINK]"

**Customer:** "I lost my job"
> **AI:** "I'm sorry to hear that. Let's work something out. I can do $260 split into 3 payments of $87. First payment when you're ready. Would that help?"

**Customer:** "This isn't my loan"
> **AI:** "I show a loan from March 15 for $500, signed from IP 192.168.1.1, deposited to account ending 4567. Does this help clarify?"

## Personalization Engine

### MySQL Query Structure
```sql
SELECT 
  -- Customer Identity
  c.id as customer_id,
  c.name,
  c.email,
  c.phone,
  
  -- Loan History Metrics
  COUNT(DISTINCT l.id) as total_loans,
  SUM(l.original_amount) as total_borrowed,
  SUM(p.amount) as total_paid,
  AVG(DATEDIFF(p.payment_date, l.due_date)) as avg_days_late,
  
  -- Payment Patterns
  DAY(MAX(p.payment_date)) as favorite_payment_day,
  DAYNAME(MAX(p.payment_date)) as favorite_weekday,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN p.type = 'partial' THEN 1 END) as partial_payments,
  
  -- Current Status
  (SELECT balance FROM current_loans WHERE customer_id = c.id) as current_balance,
  (SELECT days_overdue FROM current_loans WHERE customer_id = c.id) as days_past_due
  
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN loans l ON c.id = l.customer_id
LEFT JOIN payments p ON l.id = p.loan_id
WHERE c.id = ?
GROUP BY c.id
```

### Customer Personality Profiles

| Personality Type | Characteristics | Messaging Strategy |
|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Reliable But Slow** | Pays eventually, needs reminders | Gentle reminder, maintain perfect record |
| **Payday Payer** | Pays on 15th/30th consistently | Time to payday, convenient timing |
| **Partial Payer** | Makes small efforts | Acknowledge effort, make it easier |
| **Ghost** | Never responds but sometimes pays | One-way communication, no response needed |
| **Chronic Late** | Always struggles | Empathetic solutions, settlement focus |

---

## Redis Caching Strategy

### Why Redis?
- **Speed:** <10ms lookups vs 200-500ms MySQL queries
- **Volume:** Handles 1000 daily comms without database strain
- **State Management:** Maintains conversation context

### Cache Structure

#### Customer Profile (7-day TTL)
```json
{
  "key": "customer:123:profile",
  "data": {
    "customer_id": "123",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "phone": "+1234567890",
    "total_loans": 5,
    "total_paid": 2500,
    "current_balance": 400,
    "days_past_due": 45,
    "personality": "payday_payer",
    "authority": {
      "max_discount": 0.35,
      "min_acceptable": 260,
      "immediate_settlement": 245
    }
  }
}
```

#### Conversation Thread (7-day TTL)
```json
{
  "key": "customer:123:conversation",
  "data": {
    "status": "negotiating",
    "messages": [...last_5_messages],
    "offers_made": [
      {"amount": 275, "discount": 0.31, "timestamp": "..."}
    ],
    "strategy_used": "variant_a"
  }
}
```

---

## Settlement Authority Matrix

### Authority Calculation Logic
```javascript
function calculateAuthority(balance, daysPastDue, loanHistory) {
  let baseDiscount = 0.10; // Start at 10%
  
  // Time-based escalation
  if (daysPastDue > 30) baseDiscount += 0.05;
  if (daysPastDue > 60) baseDiscount += 0.10;
  if (daysPastDue > 90) baseDiscount += 0.10;
  
  // History-based adjustment
  if (loanHistory.defaults > 0) baseDiscount += 0.05;
  if (loanHistory.totalLoans > 5) baseDiscount -= 0.05; // Loyalty
  
  // Cap at 40% maximum discount
  const maxDiscount = Math.min(baseDiscount, 0.40);
  
  return {
    max_discount: maxDiscount,
    min_acceptable: balance * (1 - maxDiscount),
    immediate_settlement: balance * (1 - maxDiscount - 0.05),
    payment_plan_months: daysPastDue > 60 ? 6 : 3
  };
}
```

### Pre-Approved Settlement Grid

| Days Past Due | Max Discount | Payment Plan | Immediate Bonus |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|
| 0-30 days | 15% | Not offered | Extra 5% |
| 31-60 days | 25% | 3 months | Extra 5% |
| 61-90 days | 35% | 6 months | Extra 5% |
| 90+ days | 40% | 6 months | Extra 5% |

## Natural Timing System

### Fixed Delays for Natural Feel
- **Cold Outreach:** 30-second delay
- **Response Handling:** 90-second delay

### Why These Timings Work
- **30 seconds:** Long enough to seem human, short enough for urgency
- **90 seconds:** Shows consideration of their message, builds trust
- **Consistency:** Predictable without being robotic

### Future Enhancement Options
- Simple questions: 30-60 seconds
- Negotiations: 60-120 seconds  
- Settlement approvals: 90-150 seconds (shows "checking authority")
- Hostile responses: 120-180 seconds (shows careful consideration)
